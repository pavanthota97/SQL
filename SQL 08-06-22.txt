
SQL: SQL stands for Structured Query Language.

	->SQL is a standard language for storing, manipulating and retrieving data in databases.
	->SQL became a standard of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in 1986, and of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1987

What Can SQL do?
	->SQL can execute queries against a database
	->SQL can retrieve data from a database
	->SQL can insert records in a database
	->SQL can update records in a database
	->SQL can delete records from a database
	->SQL can create new databases
	->SQL can create new tables in a database
	->SQL can create stored procedures in a database
	->SQL can create views in a database
	->SQL can set permissions on tables, procedures, and views

RDBMS
	->RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System.

	->tables having rows and columns.

---------------------------------------------------------
Database is nothing but the 1.Insertion
			    2.Deletion.
			    3.Updation.
			    4.query.
Some database systems require a semicolon at the end of each SQL statement.

Semicolon is the standard way to separate each SQL statement in database systems that allow more than one SQL statement to be executed in the same call to the server.


Some of The Most Important SQL Commands:-
-> SELECT - extracts data from a database
-> UPDATE - updates data in a database
-> DELETE - deletes data from a database
-> INSERT INTO - inserts new data into a database
-> CREATE DATABASE - creates a new database
-> ALTER DATABASE - modifies a database
-> CREATE TABLE - creates a new table
-> ALTER TABLE - modifies a table
-> DROP TABLE - deletes a table
-> CREATE INDEX - creates an index (search key)
-> DROP INDEX - deletes an index

->The WHERE clause is used to filter records.
***Note: The WHERE clause is not only used in SELECT statements, it is also used in UPDATE, DELETE, etc.!

-> However, numeric fields should not be enclosed in quotes
-> Operators in The WHERE Clause
	SQL Statement:
	SELECT * FROM Products
	WHERE Price = 18;

	  Operator	Description	
		=	Equal	
		>	Greater than	
		<	Less than	
		>=	Greater than or equal	
		<=	Less than or equal	
		<>	Not equal. Note: In some versions of SQL this operator may be written as !=	
		BETWEEN	Between a certain range	
		LIKE	Search for a pattern	
		IN	To specify multiple possible values for a column


-> The ORDER BY keyword is used to sort the result-set in ascending or descending order.
-> The ORDER BY keyword sorts the records in ascending order by default. 
-> To sort the records in descending order, use the DESC keyword.
